"""users_created_at

Adds a ``created_at`` timestamp column to the ``users`` table so that the
admin analytics endpoint can report new-user signups by day without
relying on the ``hasattr`` guard that previously short-circuited the query.

The column is nullable so that existing rows are not broken; the application
default (``utcnow_naive``) ensures all new rows get a timestamp automatically.
