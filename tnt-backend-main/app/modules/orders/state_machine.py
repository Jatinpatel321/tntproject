"""Order state machine — single source of truth for lifecycle transitions.

Canonical states (PROMPT 11)
-----------------------------
PLACED    — order submitted by student (replaces PENDING for new orders)
CONFIRMED — vendor has accepted the order
READY     — vendor has prepared the order; QR pickup can be generated
PICKED    — student has collected the order (terminal)
CANCELLED — order cancelled by student, vendor, or admin (terminal)

Backward-compatible legacy states (kept for existing DB rows)
------------------------------------------------------------
PENDING         → equivalent to PLACED
READY_FOR_PICKUP → equivalent to READY
COMPLETED       → equivalent to PICKED

Allowed transitions (product-defined)
--------------------------------------
                     → CONFIRMED  READY  PICKED  CANCELLED
  PLACED / PENDING   :     ✓                        ✓
  CONFIRMED          :             ✓                ✓
  READY /
  READY_FOR_PICKUP   :                    ✓         ✓
  PICKED / COMPLETED :  (terminal — no further transitions)
  CANCELLED          :  (terminal — no further transitions)

``validate_transition`` is called by ``update_order_status`` BEFORE any
role-specific logic, so an invalid transition is always rejected regardless
of who is requesting it.
