"""
Global pytest configuration.

Auto-patches the app's Redis client with fakeredis for every test in this
workspace.  This means:

  • No test needs a live Redis server.
  • Rate-limit counters are isolated per test (fakeredis.FakeRedis() is
    reset for each test via ``autouse=True``).
  • Tests that previously passed without caring about Redis continue to
    work — they just have a harmless in-memory Redis available.
  • Tests that explicitly want to control Redis (e.g. test_rate_limiting.py)
    can still patch ``app.core.rate_limit.redis_client`` with their own
    fakeredis instance inside the test; their local patch takes precedence
    over this session-level one.
